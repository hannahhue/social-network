# Social Network

## Description

Social network is designed to mimic handling a large amount of data with mongo and still having an efficient back end. I utilized mogo schemas, express routes, and insomnia to confirm all work. My motivation was to see if i could take the routing knowledge from prior assignments and sucessfully implement the new mongo elements. Although i struggled with the delete functions I feel pretty good about my work. It makes connecting tables easier, more ledgible in my opinion and connecing the modles easier than ever.
